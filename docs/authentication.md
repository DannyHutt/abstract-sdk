title: Authentication
---

Authentication with the SDK is achieved by using an OAuth access token. You can [generate a personal access](https://app.goabstract.com/account/tokens) token for your own account on the Abstract website.

  > API tokens should be treated like a password, as they provide access to all data that your user has access to. Do not commit them to version control.

## Usage

To use the token simply save it in your environment as `ABSTRACT_TOKEN` and it will automatically be used. You can also use another method to load the token and pass it to the SDK on initialization â€“ see [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) for more details.
